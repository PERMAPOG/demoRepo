ChirpStack Setup with Node-RED and Gateway
Introduction

This document provides an overview of the setup process for ChirpStack with Node-RED integration and the gateway configuration used in the project.
Prerequisites

    ChirpStack installed
    Node-RED installed
    Gateway hardware

ChirpStack Setup

    Install ChirpStack Components:
        ChirpStack Network Server
        ChirpStack Application Server
        ChirpStack Gateway Bridge

    Configuration:
        Configure the chirpstack-network-server.toml file with the necessary parameters, including network settings and database configurations.
        Configure the chirpstack-application-server.toml file similarly.

    Database Setup:
        Set up PostgreSQL databases for both network and application servers.
        Create users and assign necessary permissions.

    Starting Services:
        Start the ChirpStack services in the following order:
            ChirpStack Gateway Bridge
            ChirpStack Network Server
            ChirpStack Application Server

Node-RED Integration

    Install Node-RED:
        Follow the official Node-RED installation guide.

    Node-RED ChirpStack Nodes:
        Install the node-red-contrib-chirpstack nodes for integration.

    Creating Flows:
        Create flows in Node-RED to handle data from ChirpStack.
        Use MQTT nodes to subscribe to ChirpStack topics.
        Process and visualize data as needed.

Gateway Setup

    Hardware Configuration:
        Connect the gateway hardware and ensure it is powered up.
        Configure the gateway to communicate with the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.

    Gateway Bridge Configuration:
        Edit the chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml file to include the gateway specifics.

    Starting the Gateway:
        Start the gateway and check for connectivity with ChirpStack.
        Ensure the gateway is correctly forwarding data to ChirpStack.

Testing and Verification

    Testing Connectivity:
        Verify that the gateway is correctly forwarding data to the ChirpStack Network Server.
        Check the status of devices and data flows in the ChirpStack Application Server.

    Node-RED Flow Verification:
        Ensure that Node-RED is receiving and processing data from ChirpStack as expected.

Conclusion

This setup provides a reliable integration of ChirpStack with Node-RED for efficient data handling and visualization. For any further details, refer to the official documentation of ChirpStack and Node-RED.
